# High Performance Computing Systems using MPI and OpenMPI

This repository contains implementations of parallel computing algorithms using the MPI and OpenMPI libraries. The programs were developed as part of a course on High Performance Computing Systems.

## Programs

### MPI Prime Number Counter

This program counts the number of prime numbers between 2 and a given limit, using the MPI library for parallel computing.

### MPI Random Number Generator

This program generates a large number of random numbers using simple generator with the MPI library for parallel computing.

### OpenMP Monte Carlo PI Estimation

This program estimates the value of PI using a Monte Carlo simulation with OpenMP for parallel computing.
